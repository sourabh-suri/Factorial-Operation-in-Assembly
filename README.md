# Factorial-Operation-in-Assembly  
A few random unsigned integers are stored from the internal data memory location 31H onwards.  
Number of term (N) is available in location 30H.  
Assuming that none of these numbers is greater than 5, hence an ALP to find the factorials of these integers and then find their sum.    
Assuming that the sum would not exceed 8-bit value.
